Employees spent hours hunting for policies. Asking managers. Pinging coworkers on Teams. "Where's the PTO policy?" "How do I expense this?" Constant frustration.

Built a chatbot with RAG. Get the answer in seconds instead of asking around.

How it works:

- Vector-based semantic search using pgvector for document retrieval
- Responses grounded in company documentation (no hallucinations)
- Plain English questions, specific answers
- Policy lookups went from hours to seconds " employees love it
