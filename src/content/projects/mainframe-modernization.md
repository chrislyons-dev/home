The mainframe was a 40-year-old beast. Processing billions in transactions. Couldn't just flip a switch.

Migrated it piece by piece over 18 months. Business kept running.

How it worked:

- Strangler pattern migration from Db2 on z/OS to PostgreSQL — zero data loss
- Decomposed monolith into event-driven microservices using Kafka for async communication
- Containerized services on Kubernetes with auto-scaling and self-healing
- 60% infrastructure cost reduction while improving performance and developer velocity
