## Deployment

Primary deployment: **Cloudflare Pages** (automatic on push to `main`)

```bash
npm run build  # Output in dist/
```

See [.docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](.docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for platform-specific guides.

## Security Headers

Strict transport and isolation headers are defined in `public/_headers`. They enforce:

- Hardened CSP aligned with current assets (self-hosted scripts plus hashed inline theme bootstrap)
- Frame protection via `frame-ancestors 'none'` and `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- COOP/CORP for process isolation, plus HSTS, Referrer-Policy, and restrictive Permissions-Policy

> During CD, `scripts/generate-csp-headers.mjs` re-builds the CSP hash list after every `npm run build`, so the deployed `_headers` file always matches the inline scripts emitted by Astro without requiring manual updates.

Cloudflare Pages automatically picks up this file at deploy time.
